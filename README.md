# Scraped Comm-Links
This repository contains the raw HTML of scraped Comm-Links from RSI.

It is a semi-recent mirror of files used by the [Star Citizen Wiki API](https://github.com/StarCitizenWiki/API).

Each folder corresponds to the ID of a given Comm-Link. File versions are scraped at the start of each month.  
The name format is as follows: `YYYY-MM-DD_hhmmss.html`.
